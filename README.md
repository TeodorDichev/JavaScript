## Key Projects (TelebidPro Internship)

During my internship, I focused on building functional, data-driven applications. Each project addresses specific real-world data handling:

* **[ekatte](./ekatte)** – A tool for processing and searching the Unified Classifier of Administrative-Territorial and Territorial Units (EKATTE) in Bulgaria. Focuses on efficient data parsing and hierarchical structures.
* **[chitanka](./chitanka)** – A project interacting with literary databases/APIs, focusing on asynchronous operations, fetching data, and UI rendering.
* **[geophone](./geophone)** – A utility for phone number validation and geographic localization, practicing Regex and internationalization standards.
